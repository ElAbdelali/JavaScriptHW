Subject: SUPER URGENT This trend will make us rich!

Hey,

We've been really impressed how you handed all the melons
in your python server. We don't understand all the details,
but it appears that you can make magic!

Therefore we feel you need a better challenge. We have been
reading all about the "thick client" being the trend, which
means shifting as much code "work" to the client browser
(not the server). Although we don't really know what this
means, we are sure you will be able to make it happen and
make us rich.

To start with, can you please look at this old Python script
that we use to count melons in a shopping cart? It's so last
year. Can you translate this to JavaScript?

Let us know as soon as you are ready to implement our future.
(And my summer retreat needs a sauna upgrade. So last year.)

Thanks,
Mel
Team Lead

# To Do

Mel doesn’t really make great engineering design decisions… this is code is awful! However, you need that bonus for your Halloween costume.

Translate melon_counting.py to a new JavaScript file called melonCounting.js

Test melonCounting.js in node.
